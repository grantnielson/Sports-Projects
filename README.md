### These are two data visualization projects I carried out to expand my skills in R, and provide interesting graphics to answer my questions and appeal to other BYU fans on Twitter.


For 'BYU STATES RECORDS', I was interested in visualizations with a US map, so I decided to depict BYU's all-time football record in each state they played during the 2022-'23 season.

QBR is a plot comparing QBRs (per ESPN, I know there are many different QBR metrics out there), using data from cfbfastR. 
I felt that Jaren Hall (BYU's QB) performed better (QBR) than the team did (W/L record); looking at the results, it seems like he did. 
He also outperformed all other QBs he faced, except one.
